### 2) Child psychology loops → concrete mechanics

| Loop | What 6-7 year olds need | Concrete v4 mechanics |
|---|---|---|
| Autonomy | “I choose my adventure” with bounded freedom | 3 daily quest doors (Build, Explore, Help); kid avatar identity system; world themes unlock by play, not purchase |
| Competence | Fast success, visible mastery | 2-minute starter tasks, then layered challenge; “I made this” gallery; skill badges for simple verbs (stack, connect, decorate, rescue) |
| Social imagination | Pretend play and narrative projection | NPC friend cast, role cards (builder, explorer, animal keeper), asynchronous “visit my world” postcards with no free chat |
| Short-session rewards | 8-12 minute satisfying loops | Every session ends with guaranteed reward + one “tomorrow hook”; streaks reward cosmetics, never power |

### 3) Moat matrix (v4)

| Moat | Why it matters | Execution implications |
|---|---|---|
| Safety-trust moat | Parents choose trusted products repeatedly | COPPA-by-design, no open chat by default, strong parent controls, transparent data practices |
| Kid-first fantasy content engine | Competitors can clone blocks, not world-feel cadence | Weekly “tiny wonder” drops, monthly themed realms, narrative arcs tied to creations |
| Creation-to-story loop moat | Most apps separate building from pretend play | Every build can become a quest scene automatically (spawn NPC prompts, mini objectives) |
| Reliability moat (save/perf/offline) | Parents churn fast on crashes/data loss | Crash-resistant autosave, offline play, low-end device targets, instant resume |
| Monetization trust moat | IAP friction is top churn driver in kid apps | Clear “free forever core,” cosmetic-only paid content, no manipulative timers |
| Family graph moat | Household-level retention beats single-user retention | Shared family hub, sibling-safe profiles, parent co-play prompts, printable/off-screen extensions |

### 4) Retrospective: why “Minecraft-lite” versions miss fantasy, and v4 fix

| Common miss in prior versions | v4 correction |
|---|---|
| Too much “sandbox utility,” not enough magical story payoff | Tie every build to a living fantasy consequence (new character, event, or quest) |
| Tutorial-heavy starts kill wonder | Start with instant playful scene + optional guided hints |
| Monetization interrupts imagination | Keep core fantasy loop uninterrupted; monetize only optional cosmetics/expansions |
| Social is either unsafe or absent | Use safe async sharing + parent-approved friend graph |
| Progress feels flat (“just more blocks”) | Add age-fit mastery tracks and seasonal “world chapters” |
| Creation isn’t celebrated | Build museum, weekly showcase, kid-friendly recap reel at session end |

**Bottom line:** v4 wins if it feels like **“my magical world I can shape safely in 10 minutes”** rather than a smaller Minecraft clone.
