# Fantasy Gap Analysis — Why v3 Missed and How v4 Corrects It

## Retrospective: why prior versions underperformed expectation

The previous iteration delivered cleaner UI but did not deliver the emotional fantasy kids expect from a Minecraft-like loop.

| Expectation from kids (6–7) | Where v3 fell short | v4 correction |
|---|---|---|
| "Night is scary, I need to prepare" | Weak survival pressure and no strong dusk-to-night urgency | Short deterministic day/dusk/night cycle + visible warning + night danger |
| "Mining and building keep me safe" | Mine/place existed but was not tied tightly to safety outcome | Shelter score directly reduces night damage and danger pressure |
| "Crafting gives immediate power" | Crafting felt abstract and detached from moment-to-moment stakes | 4 tiny recipes, each with immediate effect (torch, planks, stone, pickaxe) |
| "There is a nice friend and scary enemy" | Mob roles lacked clear contrast and cadence | Glowmew helper (day gifts), Boom Sprout chaser (night), Sky Wyrm periodic boss event |
| "I can recover and try again" | Failure did not support strong tension-release loop | Forgiving rescue reset and fast retry while preserving progression |
| "This is my world" | Session arc felt mission-like, less sandbox ownership | Always-on mine/place loop with local save and persistent world state |

## v4 fantasy fidelity criteria

A first-time player should be able to answer **yes** to at least 4/5:
1. I felt pressure to build before dark.
2. Mining and crafting helped me survive.
3. I met one friendly and one scary night archetype.
4. My shelter score changed my survival odds.
5. Sunrise felt rewarding and made me want one more loop.
