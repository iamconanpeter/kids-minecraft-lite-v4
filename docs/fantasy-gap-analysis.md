# Fantasy Gap Analysis — v3 -> v4

## Executive summary

Conan’s pivot is correct: v3 was technically competent but emotionally off-target for “kid Minecraft-like fantasy.”

v4 corrects this by making the expected fantasy pillars the center of the product:
- day/night urgency
- mine/place world interaction
- tiny crafting with survival consequence
- friendly vs danger mob archetypes
- shelter-before-night pressure

## Why v3 felt wrong

| Expected fantasy signal | v3 reality | Gap impact |
|---|---|---|
| “Night is coming, build now!” | Mission structure without strong day/night survival pressure | Low urgency and weak identity |
| “Mine and place to survive” | Build interactions mostly puzzle-oriented | Building felt abstract, less adventure feel |
| “Craft useful things fast” | Crafting not tightly linked to immediate danger mitigation | Reduced cause-effect satisfaction |
| “Cute friend and scary enemy” | Buddy flavor existed; danger archetypes not strongly contrasted | Emotional arc flattened |
| “My shelter protects me” | Shelter mechanics not central to survival loop | Kids cannot feel meaningful safety progression |

Retrospective verdict:
- v3 optimized UX first.
- v4 must optimize **fantasy loop first**, then UX support.

## v4 fantasy fidelity model

### Pillar requirements
1. **Day/night cycle with visible pressure**
2. **Mine/place loop always available**
3. **3–5 craft recipes with immediate payoffs**
4. **3 archetype mobs**: helper, chaser, boss-event
5. **Shelter score affects night safety directly**

### Session arc target (3–8 minutes)
- Minute 0–2: gather and place starter shelter blocks
- Minute 2–4: dusk warning + emergency crafting
- Minute 4–6: survive night/chaser pressure
- Minute 6–8: sunrise stars, unlock, repeat

## Legal-safe fantasy mapping (expectation -> original implementation)

This mapping is required for legal-safe delivery.

| Market fantasy expectation | Original v4 implementation (ship-safe) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Green exploding stalker-like enemy | **Boom Sprout** (night chaser) | Original silhouette, original VFX timing |
| Tall shadow stalker-like fear archetype | **Gloom Stalker** behavior cues in night phase (non-branded) | Behavior archetype only, no copied look/lore |
| Sky dragon boss-like event | **Sky Wyrm** (periodic boss event) | Original art/name/attack rhythm |
| Friendly companion mob | **Glowmew** (helper pet) | Gift loop and emotional anchor |
| Torch/light safety fantasy | **Lantern Totem** crafted light block | Distinct naming and visual style |

Compliance rules:
- No trademarked names, logos, textures, sounds, or lore.
- Archetype inspiration allowed; implementation must remain original in naming/art/animation.

## Acceptance signal for “now feels right”

v4 should be judged successful when first-time kids can answer “yes” to:
1. “Did I need to build before dark?”
2. “Did mining and crafting help me survive?”
3. “Was there a nice creature and a scary night creature?”
4. “Did my shelter actually make me safer?”
5. “Did I feel like I was in a block-world adventure?”

If 4/5+ are true in playtest, fantasy gap is considered closed for MVP.
